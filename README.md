# ARPlayground

This project was first built on the resource packs and guidance provided by the Meta AR Developer Professional Certificate. It uses ARFoundation to showcase and provides practice on some of the basic functionalities in Unity AR development.

This repository builds on the framework and tweaks the game for a more complete experience and will be used to experiment on different features possible with Android devices. While the scope of this project may continue to evolve, but it fundamentally serves as a future reference and a nice starting point as a beginner AR developer.
